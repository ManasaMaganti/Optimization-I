# Optimization-I
This repository consists of some optimization projects that I worked on as part of my MSBA course curriculum at McCombs.
There are three projects - 
 - Image Segmentation using Linear Programming
 - Portfolio Selection - Tracking NASDAQ 100 Index
 - NewsPaper Vendor Model - Predicting the Demand
